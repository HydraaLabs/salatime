/**
 * AdminKit's app.css already ships self-contained LTR/RTL pairs for sidebar
 * positioning, gated behind `body[data-sidebar-position="right"]` (covers
 * sidebar margins, collapse/expand, navbar-align, scrollbar track — at every
 * breakpoint). rtlcss has no way to know that, so it blindly re-mirrors those
 * already-correct rules too, producing a second, contradictory copy. Since
 * app-rtl.css loads after app.css, its mirrored copy wins the cascade and
 * fights the theme's own correct values once the attribute is set.
 *
 * Rather than re-deriving every breakpoint by hand, just drop any rule whose
 * selector references this attribute from the generated RTL file — the
 * original app.css already has the correct counterpart for both states.
